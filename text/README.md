This is a place to stash sentence-by-sentence text of War And Peace, for the hit podcast [War in Pieces](https://warinpeic.es).

The source of the text is [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/warpeace01tols_0/page/n7/mode/2up) and is in the public domain. This particular translation and edition is the canonical source for War and Peace in English, as far as War in Pieces is concerned.

Of course, the transliteration to a machine-readable, sentence-by-sentence annotation is an ongoing effort. Pull requests accepted, but I'm not yet sure how I will verify new text without human verification. I know for a fact (through direct experimentation) that OpenAI's ChatGPT implementation produces at least one error per page, due to LLM architecture reasons.

I will probably need to combine OCR with some regexes or some similiar hack to get error-free text. Experiment next with [spaCy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaCy).
