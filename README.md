# FAQ

1. How often do you publish this podcast?

We publish exactly one sentence, per day.

2. What is a sentence?

This is discussed, at some length, at [text/README.md](text/README.md), with the goal of balancing mechanical definitions of "sentence" with narrative and creative flexibility.

3. What is a day?

In most cases, sentences will be released approximately 24 hours from each other, though some exceptions may occur. A day is one calendar day, on Earth, unless or until the current steward of this podcast is a resident of another planet or other rotating body. Importantly, this means that two sentences may be released arbitrarily close together, provided they fall on adjacent calendar days. One sentence may be released at any time on a calendar day; the next may be released at any time on the following calendar day. This can result in pairs of sentences being separated by either more or less than 24 hours of wall-clock time. Note, sentence releases may occasionally be affected by [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second), which can cause a particular calendar day to be slightly longer or shorter than 24 hours in SI seconds, but these leap seconds do not alter the calendar-day ordering constraints.
